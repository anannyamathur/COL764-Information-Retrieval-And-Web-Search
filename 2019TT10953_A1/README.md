# Assignment 1 - Inverted Index Construction

## TOPICS COVERED
- Preprocessing the Data
- Building the Index Files
- Boolean Retrieval

## REQUIREMENTS
- `pip install xml`, `pip install bs4` to use beautifulsoup library of python for parsing xml files
- `pip install python-snappy` to use Python library for the snappy compression library from Google

## PROGRAM STRUCTURE
- `invidx_cons.py` conducts inverted indexing of the collection and produces two files- `indexfile.dict` `indexfile.idx`  
It can be called in two ways-  
`python invidx_cons.py [coll-path] [indexfile] [stopwordfile] {0|1|2|3|4|5} [xml-tags-info] `  
OR  
`/.invidx.sh [coll-path] [indexfile] [stopwordfile] {0|1|2|3|4|5} [xml-tags-info]` where,  
   ```
   collpath -- specifies the directory containing the files containing documents of the collection
   indexfile -- is the name of the index files that will be generated by the program
   stopwordfile --is a file that contains the stopwords that should be elimiinated
   {0|1|2|3|4|5}-- these specify the compressions that will be applied
   xml-tags-info -- is a file that contains the tag for document identifier in the first line, followed by tags that contain the indexable portion in each line, starting from the second line
   ```

- `boolsearch.sh` `boolsearch.py` for performing Boolean retrieval using the index built above  
It can be called by-  
`/.boolsearch.sh [queryfile] [resultfile] [indexfile] [dictfile]`   
OR  
`python boolsearch.py [queryfile] [resultfile] [indexfile] [dictfile]`
where,  
   ```
   queryfile: a file containing keyword queries

   resultfile: output file named resultfile which is generated by the program

   indexfile: the index file generated by invidx_cons program above is used for evaluating the queries

   dictfile the dictionary file generated by the invidx cons program above which is used for evaluating the queries

   ```
